name database:
	- Name database is object where name mappings for all the rtanks classes, interfaces, variables, functions etc are stored.
	- Deobfuscation passes will check mapping for every name when it is read from the code.
	- The last pass will write the database names to the code.

idea of passes:
	1. Basic class, interface and package deobfuscation pass (will be executed 3 or even more times)
		1. calculates hash using these methods:
			- import count
			- variable count
			- function count
			- function signutures
			- package names

		2. compares rtanks hashes to mytanks hashes
		3. renames the tartgets(classes, interfaces etc.) from name database, if hashes are matching

	3. Basic variable and function deobfuscation pass
	4. Advanced variable and function deobfuscation pass
		1. loops through every file and finds out where every variable and function is ussed/called
		2. calculates hash using the data which we collected in step 1
		3. compares rtanks hashes to mytanks hashes
		4. renames the tartgets(variabes and functions) from name database, if hashes are matching

	5. Code edit pass
		1. All the changed names from name database are written to the code.
		2. Saves the modified code
